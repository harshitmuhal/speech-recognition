Google has a great Speech Recognition API which converts spoken text (microphone) into written text (Python strings).
The audio is recorded using the speech recognition module and the recorded speech is sent to the Google speech recognition API which will then return the output(python string).

(Google Speech API v2 is limited to 50 queries per day and requires a good microphone)

# modules needed- SpeechRecognition, PyAudio

speechrecognition.py program recognises the input audio and then search it in default webbrowser using webbrowser module.
